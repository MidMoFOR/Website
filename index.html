            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Mid-MO FOR is a group composed of people from many faiths, and no particular faith -- all coming together to support nonviolence and justice. Offering people of conscience an action response to a morally-impaired U.S. foreign policy.</p>

            <h3>Join Us</h3>
            <p>We welcome all people committed to peace and justice to join us in our work. Together, we can make a difference in our community and beyond.</p>
      
			<p> Right now our siblings all over this nation are under attack from the fascists we currently have in office. Not only at the national level, but also here at the state level. It is our responsibility to help protect them. But we need help. We can't defeat this unless we are united. Please consider joining us in this fight. </p>
