            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The Mid-Missouri Fellowship of Reconciliation (Mid-MO FOR) is a group composed of people from many faiths, and no particular faith -- all coming together to support nonviolence and justice. Offering people of conscience an action response to a morally-impaired U.S. foreign policy.</p>

            <h3>Join Us</h3>
            <p>We welcome all people committed to peace and justice to join us in our work. Together, we can make a difference in our community and beyond.</p>
      
			<p> Our siblings across the nation are facing real harm and persecution at the hands of the destructive forces in power. This attack comes from both Washington and here at home at our State Capitol. In the face of this injustice, we must choose solidarity and peace. It is our moral duty to stand together and protect one another. No one should have to face this fight alone. Through unity, compassion, and collective action, we can build a better future. We ask you to join us, not out of fear, but out of love for our communities, and a shared belief in justice, dignity, and peace for all. </p>
