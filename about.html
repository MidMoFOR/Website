            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) was founded in 1914 as an international organization promoting non-violence and peace. The Mid-Missouri chapter was established in 1961 to help strengthen our local community's commitment to justice and reconciliation through active outreach and education.</p>
